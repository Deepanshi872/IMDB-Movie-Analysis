# IMDB-Movie-Analysis
This repository inclued a dataset of movies to uncover insights into trends, genre popularity, and factors influencing success. Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn), I explored relationships between budget, revenue, and ratings, providing a deeper understanding of movie performance across different genres and years
